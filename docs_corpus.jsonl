Create user and role in Snowflake Create a role and user in Snowflake using the following commands: Create role Create a role in Snowflake using the following commands: Replace with the default warehouse to use when running the Snowflake crawler . Atlan requires the following privileges to: OPERATE enables Atlan to start the virtual warehouse to fetch metadata if the warehouse has stopped. USAGE enables Atlan to show or list metadata from Snowflake. This in turn enables the Snowflake crawler to run the SHOW query. Create a user Create a separate user to integrate into Atlan, using one of the following 3 options: See Snowflake's official guide for details on generating an RSA key-pair . To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for rsa_public_key with the public key and run the following: Learn more about the SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace and run the following: Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . This method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) authenticating natively through Okta : Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and use federated authentication in Snowflake . The password for this user must be maintained solely in the IdP and multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be disabled. Grant role to user To grant the atlan_user_role to the new user: Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID To configure OAuth authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with the client credentials flow: Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION external_oauth_azure_ad TYPE = external_oauth ENABLED = true EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = azure EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = '\\ ' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = '\\ ' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ( '\\ ' ) EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = 'sub' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'login_name' ; Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL Azure JWKs URI Application ID URI of the Azure app In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL Azure JWKs URI Application ID URI of the Azure app Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: CREATE USER oauth_svc_user WITH LOGIN_NAME = '\\ ' -- Use Azure client OBJECT ID DEFAULT_ROLE = \\ DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = \\ ; Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: Grant the configured role to this user: GRANT ROLE \\ TO USER oauth_svc_user ; Grant the configured role to this user: Choose metadata fetching method Atlan supports two methods for fetching metadata from Snowflake - account usage and information schema. You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions.

Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. (Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all future stages at the database level: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all future stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Allowlist the Atlan IP If you are using the IP allowlist in your Snowflake instance, you must add the Atlan IP to the allowlist. Please raise a support ticket from within Atlan, or submit a request . (If you aren't using the IP allowlist in your Snowflake instance, you can skip this step.) Create user and role in Snowflake Choose metadata fetching method Grant permissions for account usage method Grant permissions for information schema method Allowlist the Atlan IP"}

Doing so automatically selects the following privileges - USE CATALOG , USE SCHEMA , EXECUTE , READ VOLUME , and SELECT . At the bottom of the dialog, click Grant . (Optional) Repeat steps 3-5 for each catalog you want to query and preview data from in Atlan. (Optional) Grant permissions to import and update tags To import Databricks tags , you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and a SQL warehouse configured. Atlan supports importing Databricks tags using system tables for all three authentication methods. Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following privileges: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.information_schema SELECT on the following tables: system.information_schema.catalog_tags system.information_schema.schema_tags system.information_schema.table_tags system.information_schema.column_tags To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Databricks, you need to grant the following privileges : APPLY TAG on the object USE CATALOG on the object's parent catalog USE SCHEMA on the object's parent schema (Optional) Grant permissions to extract lineage and usage from system tables You must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to use system tables. Atlan supports extracting the following for your Databricks assets using system tables : usage and popularity metrics Enable system.access schema You need your account admin to enable the system.access schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to extract lineage using system tables. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation : List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted . (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main ) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales ). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant .

You can also manage existing users by adding them to groups, changing their roles, or set up SSO , SCIM , and SMTP configurations. Manage access control from the governance center The Governance center is where you can build access control mechanisms to manage user access . Personas allow you to group users into teams, such as Financial Analysts or Cloud Engineers , and set policies based on the access those personas should have. Purposes are where you can build policies based on the actions or access that a user might need. For example, you can use Atlan's policy-based access controls to manage access to PII and other sensitive data. This is a best practice for data governance. Once you set these policies, Atlan will enforce them throughout your users' experience. This means that users who don't have access to a particular type of data will not be able to see it. Governance workflows help you set up robust controls on data access management, metadata enrichment, new entity creation, and more, with out-of-the-box workflow templates and automated execution. Asset profile The asset profile in Atlan gives you a quick and clear understanding of what a data asset contains. You can think of the asset profile as the TL;DR about your data.

Provide your API token as the second parameter. You can also read the value from another environment variable, by leaving out this parameter. You can then start writing some actual code to run within a static main method. (We'll show some examples of this further below.) Once the block is complete, any resources held by the client (i.e. for caching) will be automatically released. Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. The SDK is available on PyPI . You can use pip to install it as follows: Provide two values to create an Atlan client: Provide your Atlan tenant URL to the base_url parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .) Provide your API token to the api_key parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .) Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. The SDK is available on Maven Central , ready to be included in your project: Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include slf4j-simple as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out), along with the kotlin-logging-jvm microutil. Provide two values to create an Atlan client: Provide your Atlan tenant URL as the first parameter. You can also read the value from an environment variable, if you leave out both parameters.

The SDK is available on GitHub , ready to be included in your project: Provide two values to set up connectivity to Atlan: Provide your Atlan tenant URL to the assets.Context() method. If you prefer using the value from an environment variable, you can use assets.NewContext() without any parameters. Provide your API token as the second parameter to the assets.Context() method. (Or again, have it picked up automatically by the assets.NewContext() method.) Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED .

And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\". Finally, from the batch you can retrieve the minimal details about any assets it created or updated. Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You can then add() any updated objects directly into the batch you created earlier. The batch itself will handle saving these to Atlan when a sufficient number have been queued up (20, in this example).

Create user and role in Snowflake Create a role and user in Snowflake using the following commands: Create role Create a role in Snowflake using the following commands: Replace with the default warehouse to use when running the Snowflake crawler . Atlan requires the following privileges to: OPERATE enables Atlan to start the virtual warehouse to fetch metadata if the warehouse has stopped. USAGE enables Atlan to show or list metadata from Snowflake. This in turn enables the Snowflake crawler to run the SHOW query. Create a user Create a separate user to integrate into Atlan, using one of the following 3 options: See Snowflake's official guide for details on generating an RSA key-pair . To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for rsa_public_key with the public key and run the following: Learn more about the SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace and run the following: Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . This method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) authenticating natively through Okta : Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and use federated authentication in Snowflake .

Grant role to user To grant the atlan_user_role to the new user: Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID To configure OAuth authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with the client credentials flow: Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION external_oauth_azure_ad TYPE = external_oauth ENABLED = true EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = azure EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = '\\ ' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = '\\ ' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ( '\\ ' ) EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = 'sub' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'login_name' ; Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL Azure JWKs URI Application ID URI of the Azure app In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL Azure JWKs URI Application ID URI of the Azure app Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: CREATE USER oauth_svc_user WITH LOGIN_NAME = '\\ ' -- Use Azure client OBJECT ID DEFAULT_ROLE = \\ DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = \\ ; Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: Grant the configured role to this user: GRANT ROLE \\ TO USER oauth_svc_user ; Grant the configured role to this user: Choose metadata fetching method Atlan supports two methods for fetching metadata from Snowflake - account usage and information schema. You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan.

USAGE enables Atlan to show or list metadata from Snowflake. This in turn enables the Snowflake crawler to run the SHOW query. Create a user Create a separate user to integrate into Atlan, using one of the following 3 options: See Snowflake's official guide for details on generating an RSA key-pair . To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for rsa_public_key with the public key and run the following: Learn more about the SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace and run the following: Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation .

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name.

Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone.

To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored.

(Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling.

Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan.

(Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database.

You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead.

Create a user Create a separate user to integrate into Atlan, using one of the following 3 options: See Snowflake's official guide for details on generating an RSA key-pair . To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for rsa_public_key with the public key and run the following: Learn more about the SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone.

The miner will not mine any queries that ran before that time window. If the queries that created your assets ran before that time window, lineage for those assets will not be present. To mine more than the previous two weeks of query history, either use S3-based query mining or contact Atlan support . Note that Snowflake itself only retains query history for so long as well, though. Once Snowflake itself no longer contains the query history we will be unable to mine it for lineage. Lineage is unsupported for parameterized queries. Snowflake currently does not resolve values for parameterized queries before logging them in query history. This limits Atlan from generating lineage in such cases. When using the account usage extraction method, there are currently some limitations. We are working with Snowflake to find workarounds for crawling the following: External table location data Procedures Primary key designation External table location data Primary key designation Furthermore, only database-level filtering is currently possible. When using the account usage method for fetching metadata, Atlan requires access to the following views in Snowflake: For the crawler: DATABASES , SCHEMATA , TABLES , VIEWS , COLUMNS , and PIPES For the miner and popularity metrics : QUERY_HISTORY , ACCESS_HISTORY , and SESSIONS This error can occur when you're connecting to Snowflake through Okta SSO and enter the URL of your Snowflake instance in a format different from the one used in Okta. Snowflake follows two URL formats: Legacy format - . .snowflakecomputing.com or . . .snowflakecomputing.com New URL format - - .snowflakecomputing.com Ensure that you're using the same Snowflake URL format in Snowflake and Okta. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. If you're getting the following error messages - java.net.UnknownHostException and Name or service not known - this is a known error for users who have upgraded to the Snowflake JDBC driver version 3.13.25., have underscores in their account name, and connect to their Snowflake accounts over private link (for example, https:\/\/my_account.us-west-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com ). If your Snowflake account name has an underscore - for example, my_account - the updated JDBC driver will automatically convert underscores to dashes or hyphens - . This does not affect normal URLs because Snowflake accepts URLs with both hyphens and underscores. For private link users, however, the JDBC driver will return an error if there are underscores present in the account name and the connection will fail.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan.

(Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database.

Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone.

(Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database.

Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling.

Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.)

The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored.

(Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles.

Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more.

(Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan.

Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different.

For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace and run the following: Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . This method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) authenticating natively through Okta : Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and use federated authentication in Snowflake .

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone.

(Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database.

Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling.

Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead.

(Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets.

You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles.

Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name.

Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.)

The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead.

To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace and run the following: Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . This method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) authenticating natively through Okta : Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and use federated authentication in Snowflake . The password for this user must be maintained solely in the IdP and multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be disabled. Grant role to user To grant the atlan_user_role to the new user: Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID To configure OAuth authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with the client credentials flow: Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION external_oauth_azure_ad TYPE = external_oauth ENABLED = true EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = azure EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = '\\ ' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = '\\ ' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ( '\\ ' ) EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = 'sub' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'login_name' ; Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL Azure JWKs URI Application ID URI of the Azure app In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL Azure JWKs URI Application ID URI of the Azure app Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: CREATE USER oauth_svc_user WITH LOGIN_NAME = '\\ ' -- Use Azure client OBJECT ID DEFAULT_ROLE = \\ DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = \\ ; Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: Grant the configured role to this user: GRANT ROLE \\ TO USER oauth_svc_user ; Grant the configured role to this user: Choose metadata fetching method Atlan supports two methods for fetching metadata from Snowflake - account usage and information schema. You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Grant permissions for account usage method If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. Replace with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: To crawl future streams: Replace with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: Replace with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: : The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). : The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. : The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: Replace with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: Replace with the name of the cloned database, and with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. Replace with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) For any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation . To grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to preview and query in Atlan.) Verify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. (Optional) To import Snowflake tags Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To import tags from Snowflake , grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: Replace with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake , grant these permissions: You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation . (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: Grant permissions at a schema level: Replace with the database and with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: You must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all future stages at the database level: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all future stages at the database level: Replace with the name of your Snowflake database Replace with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Allowlist the Atlan IP If you are using the IP allowlist in your Snowflake instance, you must add the Atlan IP to the allowlist. Please raise a support ticket from within Atlan, or submit a request .

Doing so automatically selects the following privileges - USE CATALOG , USE SCHEMA , EXECUTE , READ VOLUME , and SELECT . At the bottom of the dialog, click Grant . (Optional) Repeat steps 3-5 for each catalog you want to query and preview data from in Atlan. (Optional) Grant permissions to import and update tags To import Databricks tags , you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and a SQL warehouse configured. Atlan supports importing Databricks tags using system tables for all three authentication methods. Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following privileges: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.information_schema SELECT on the following tables: system.information_schema.catalog_tags system.information_schema.schema_tags system.information_schema.table_tags system.information_schema.column_tags To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Databricks, you need to grant the following privileges : APPLY TAG on the object USE CATALOG on the object's parent catalog USE SCHEMA on the object's parent schema (Optional) Grant permissions to extract lineage and usage from system tables You must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to use system tables. Atlan supports extracting the following for your Databricks assets using system tables : usage and popularity metrics Enable system.access schema You need your account admin to enable the system.access schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to extract lineage using system tables. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation : List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted . (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main ) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales ). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant . Enter the user or group name (principal). Assign the following permissions: USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table Click Grant to apply the changes. These privileges enable Atlan to read table definitions and other metadata from the metastore. (Optional) enable system.query schema This is only required if you also want to extract usage and popularity metrics from Databricks. You need your account admin to enable the system.query schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to mine query history using system tables for usage and popularity metrics. To verify that system schemas is enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation . If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . Grant permissions Atlan supports extracting Databricks lineage and usage and popularity metrics using system tables for all three authentication methods . Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following permissions: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE_CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.access schema USE SCHEMA on system.query schema (tomine query history for usage and popularity metrics) SELECT on the following tables: system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) system.access.table_lineage system.access.column_lineage system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) You need to create a Databricks connection in Atlan for each metastore. You can use the hostname of your Unity Catalog-enabled workspace as the Host for the connection. ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . (Optional) Create cloned views of system tables When you don't want to grant access to system tables directly, you can create cloned views to expose lineage and popularity metrics through a separate schema. Follow these steps to set up cloned views: Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema . Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema .

Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation : List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted . (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main ) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales ). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant . Enter the user or group name (principal). Assign the following permissions: USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table Click Grant to apply the changes.

(Optional) Grant permissions to import and update tags To import Databricks tags , you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and a SQL warehouse configured. Atlan supports importing Databricks tags using system tables for all three authentication methods. Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following privileges: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.information_schema SELECT on the following tables: system.information_schema.catalog_tags system.information_schema.schema_tags system.information_schema.table_tags system.information_schema.column_tags To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Databricks, you need to grant the following privileges : APPLY TAG on the object USE CATALOG on the object's parent catalog USE SCHEMA on the object's parent schema (Optional) Grant permissions to extract lineage and usage from system tables You must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to use system tables. Atlan supports extracting the following for your Databricks assets using system tables : usage and popularity metrics Enable system.access schema You need your account admin to enable the system.access schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to extract lineage using system tables. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation : List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted . (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main ) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales ). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant . Enter the user or group name (principal). Assign the following permissions: USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table Click Grant to apply the changes. These privileges enable Atlan to read table definitions and other metadata from the metastore. (Optional) enable system.query schema This is only required if you also want to extract usage and popularity metrics from Databricks. You need your account admin to enable the system.query schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to mine query history using system tables for usage and popularity metrics. To verify that system schemas is enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation . If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . Grant permissions Atlan supports extracting Databricks lineage and usage and popularity metrics using system tables for all three authentication methods . Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following permissions: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE_CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.access schema USE SCHEMA on system.query schema (tomine query history for usage and popularity metrics) SELECT on the following tables: system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) system.access.table_lineage system.access.column_lineage system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) You need to create a Databricks connection in Atlan for each metastore. You can use the hostname of your Unity Catalog-enabled workspace as the Host for the connection. ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . (Optional) Create cloned views of system tables When you don't want to grant access to system tables directly, you can create cloned views to expose lineage and popularity metrics through a separate schema. Follow these steps to set up cloned views: Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema . Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema . Create cloned views for the following system tables: Lineage tables CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW . . column_lineage AS SELECT * FROM system . access . column_lineage ; CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW . . table_lineage AS SELECT * FROM system . access . table_lineage ; Replace and with the catalog and schema names used in your environment.

Atlan supports extracting the following for your Databricks assets using system tables : usage and popularity metrics Enable system.access schema You need your account admin to enable the system.access schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to extract lineage using system tables. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation : List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted . (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main ) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales ). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant . Enter the user or group name (principal). Assign the following permissions: USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table Click Grant to apply the changes. These privileges enable Atlan to read table definitions and other metadata from the metastore. (Optional) enable system.query schema This is only required if you also want to extract usage and popularity metrics from Databricks. You need your account admin to enable the system.query schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to mine query history using system tables for usage and popularity metrics. To verify that system schemas is enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation . If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . Grant permissions Atlan supports extracting Databricks lineage and usage and popularity metrics using system tables for all three authentication methods . Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following permissions: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE_CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.access schema USE SCHEMA on system.query schema (tomine query history for usage and popularity metrics) SELECT on the following tables: system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) system.access.table_lineage system.access.column_lineage system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) You need to create a Databricks connection in Atlan for each metastore. You can use the hostname of your Unity Catalog-enabled workspace as the Host for the connection. ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . (Optional) Create cloned views of system tables When you don't want to grant access to system tables directly, you can create cloned views to expose lineage and popularity metrics through a separate schema. Follow these steps to set up cloned views: Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema .

Atlan supports extracting the following for your Databricks assets using system tables : usage and popularity metrics Enable system.access schema You need your account admin to enable the system.access schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to extract lineage using system tables. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation : List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted . (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main ) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales ). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant . Enter the user or group name (principal). Assign the following permissions: USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table Click Grant to apply the changes.

(Optional) Repeat steps 3-5 for each catalog you want to query and preview data from in Atlan. (Optional) Grant permissions to import and update tags To import Databricks tags , you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and a SQL warehouse configured. Atlan supports importing Databricks tags using system tables for all three authentication methods. Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following privileges: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.information_schema SELECT on the following tables: system.information_schema.catalog_tags system.information_schema.schema_tags system.information_schema.table_tags system.information_schema.column_tags To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Databricks, you need to grant the following privileges : APPLY TAG on the object USE CATALOG on the object's parent catalog USE SCHEMA on the object's parent schema (Optional) Grant permissions to extract lineage and usage from system tables You must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to use system tables. Atlan supports extracting the following for your Databricks assets using system tables : usage and popularity metrics Enable system.access schema You need your account admin to enable the system.access schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to extract lineage using system tables. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation : List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted . (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main ) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales ). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant . Enter the user or group name (principal). Assign the following permissions: USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table Click Grant to apply the changes. These privileges enable Atlan to read table definitions and other metadata from the metastore. (Optional) enable system.query schema This is only required if you also want to extract usage and popularity metrics from Databricks. You need your account admin to enable the system.query schema using the SystemSchemas API . This enables Atlan to mine query history using system tables for usage and popularity metrics. To verify that system schemas is enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation . If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted . ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . Grant permissions Atlan supports extracting Databricks lineage and usage and popularity metrics using system tables for all three authentication methods . Once you have created a personal access token , an AWS service principal , or an Azure service principal , you will need to grant the following permissions: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE_CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.access schema USE SCHEMA on system.query schema (tomine query history for usage and popularity metrics) SELECT on the following tables: system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) system.access.table_lineage system.access.column_lineage system.query.history (to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) You need to create a Databricks connection in Atlan for each metastore. You can use the hostname of your Unity Catalog-enabled workspace as the Host for the connection. ð ª Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query ? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables . (Optional) Create cloned views of system tables When you don't want to grant access to system tables directly, you can create cloned views to expose lineage and popularity metrics through a separate schema. Follow these steps to set up cloned views: Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema . Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema . Create cloned views for the following system tables: Lineage tables CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW . . column_lineage AS SELECT * FROM system . access . column_lineage ; CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW . . table_lineage AS SELECT * FROM system . access . table_lineage ; Replace and with the catalog and schema names used in your environment. Popularity metrics CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW . . query_history AS SELECT * FROM system . query . history ; Replace and with the catalog and schema names used in your environment. Create cloned views for the following system tables: Lineage tables CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW . . column_lineage AS SELECT * FROM system . access . column_lineage ; CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW . . table_lineage AS SELECT * FROM system . access . table_lineage ; Replace and with the catalog and schema names used in your environment.

There are two supported options: This option grants permissions that let the service principal to access only admin-level Power BI APIs. In this mode, Atlan extracts metadata exclusively using administrative endpoints. This option is recommended for stricter access control environments. You need your Fabric Administrator ( formerly known as Power BI Administrator ) to complete these tasks - you may not have access yourself. To configure admin API access: Log in to the Power BI admin portal . Click Tenant settings under Admin portal.

{"url":"https:\/\/docs.atlan.com\/product\/integrations\/automation\/browser-extension\/concepts\/atlan-browser-extension-security","title":"Atlan browser extension security | Atlan Documentation","text":"Atlan adheres to strict security standards for the browser extension . Atlan mandates security throughout the extension coding lifecycle: Hardening configurations through content security policies, Validating all inputs, Requiring least privileges, Employing defense-in-depth techniques like code obfuscation to frustrate reverse engineering, Accessing customer resources over secure HTTPS channels after SSL certificate verification to prevent tampering. Atlan follows proven CI\/CD methodologies used for our SaaS application, enabling rapid and frequent updates to Atlan's Chrome extension. This allows: Patching identified vulnerabilities faster through new releases while simultaneously upholding stability. Mandatory code reviews specifically focused on analyzing security to help with identifying issues before these can impact customers. Once ready, both static and dynamic scanning tools rigorously test the extension codebase for any weaknesses before distribution. Atlan is committed to transparency. If any post-deployment points of concern arise, Atlan will notify impacted customers promptly and address their concerns responsibly. By incorporating security into each phase - secure architecture, peer reviews, robust testing, and responsible disclosure - Atlan strives to build browser extensions with both user needs and enterprise risks top of mind. Reach out to Atlan support for any questions. When using Atlan's browser extension in a supported tool , Atlan will read: the URL of your browser tab Document Object Model (DOM) elements such as asset title, hierarchy information, text, data-test-id attributes, and more to locate an asset in a supported source tool . This list may vary depending on the source tool. If you're using Atlan's browser extension on any website , it will only read the favicon, page title, and URL of your browser tab. Atlan uses the following permissions for the browser extension to work in a supported tool: activeTab - the activeTab permission allows the browser extension to temporarily access the content of the active tab as you interact with the extension. This enables Atlan to display the Atlan badge and read the URL and DOM elements to locate the asset for displaying asset metadata in the sidebar. storage - the storage permission allows Atlan to store information about the locally domains configured. This enables the browser extension to remember the sites that you want to use it on, even when you close and reopen your browser. host_permissions - the host permissions allow the browser extension to work specifically with Atlan tenants, which is the host in this case. For example, https:\/\/atlan.com\/* , https:\/\/atlan.dev\/* . \"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"http:\/\/*\/*\", \"https:\/\/*\/*\"] - the content_scripts key allows Atlan to inject Atlan's content script to any website you visit. Although this content script will be injected into all webpages, it will neither be executed nor any DOM elements captured if the webpage is not a supported tool."}

{"url":"https:\/\/docs.atlan.com\/product\/capabilities\/governance\/custom-metadata\/how-tos\/control-access-metadata-data","title":"Control access to metadata and data? | Atlan Documentation","text":"You can customize access for users through several mechanisms. User roles The most general mechanism is a user role . These define the very broad permissions a user has in Atlan - for example, whether they can administer other users, or only discover metadata. When it comes to what metadata and data a user can access, though, we need to use the additional mechanisms below. Connection admins Connection admins are users who manage connectivity to a data source. By default, these users can: Read and write all metadata on assets from that connection. Preview and query the data in all data assets from that connection. Manage access policies to grant others access to the assets from that connection. You define the connection admin when crawling a new data source for the first time. A connection admin can also extend the list of connection admins on their connection at any time. Access policies A user must be both an admin user and a connection admin to define access policies for the connection's assets. Access policies either allow or restrict access to certain assets. These allow you to be much more creative (and granular) about access than the all-or-nothing privileges of connection admins. You start by defining which assets to control with each policy. There are two complementary mechanisms to do this in Atlan - personas and purposes . Once you have defined the subset of assets, you can then define granular access to both metadata and data: Metadata policies Metadata policies control what users can do with the assets' metadata. Through them, you can control who can: Read : view an asset's activity log, custom metadata, and SQL queries Update : change asset metadata, including description, certification, owners, README, and resources Update Custom Metadata Values for the assets Add Tags to the assets Remove Tags from the assets Create : create new assets within the selected connection (via API) Delete : delete assets within the selected connection (via API) Data policies Data policies control what users can do with the assets' data. Through them, you can control who can: Query and preview the data within the assets Whether to hide any data, through various masking techniques: Show first 4 : replaces all the data with X except the first 4 characters of data. For example 1234 5678 9012 3456 would become 1234XXXX . Show last 4 : replaces all the data with X except the last 4 characters of data. For example 1234 5678 9012 3456 would become XXXX3456 . Hash : replaces the data with a consistent hashed value. Because the hash is consistent you can still join on it across assets. For example 1234 5678 9012 3456 would become f43jknscakc12nk21ak . Nullify : replaces the data with the null value. For example 1234 5678 9012 3456 would become null . Redact : replaces all alphabetic data with x and all numeric data with 0. For example 1234 Street Name would become 0000 Xxxxxx Xxxx . Show first 4 : replaces all the data with X except the first 4 characters of data. For example 1234 5678 9012 3456 would become 1234XXXX . Show last 4 : replaces all the data with X except the last 4 characters of data. For example 1234 5678 9012 3456 would become XXXX3456 . Hash : replaces the data with a consistent hashed value. Because the hash is consistent you can still join on it across assets. For example 1234 5678 9012 3456 would become f43jknscakc12nk21ak . Nullify : replaces the data with the null value.

Glossary policies Glossary policies can only be defined through personas. All the mechanisms above can coexist. This is powerful, but can also be a bit overwhelming to think about. What takes priority when a user is under the control of all these mechanisms? ð µ ð « It's actually not as bad as you might think - only these three rules: Access is denied by default (implicitly) By default, users will not have the permissions listed above. This remains true until you explicitly grant a user a permission. For example, imagine you have not set up any access policies and a new user joins. They will not have any of the permissions above against any assets in Atlan. Explicit grants (allows) are combined When you grant a user a permission, this is combined with all other permissions you have granted the user. Continuing our example, imagine you add the new user to a group defined as the connection admins for Snowflake. The user will now have full read\/write access to all metadata for Snowflake assets, and be able to query and preview the data in those assets. Then you add the user to a persona that gives read\/write access to a Looker project. The user will now have access to all Snowflake assets and a Looker project's assets. Explicit restrictions (denies) take priority When you explicitly deny a user a permission, this takes priority over all other permissions you have granted the user. Continuing our example, imagine you define a purpose with a data policy that masks PII data. The user will still have full read\/write access to all metadata for Snowflake assets and a Looker project's assets. In general, they will still be able to query and preview the data in the Snowflake assets. However, any PII data in Snowflake will now be masked. Then you add a metadata policy to the purpose that denies permission to remove the PII tag. The user will no longer have full read\/write access to all metadata for Snowflake assets and a Looker project's assets. The user can no longer remove the PII tag from any of these assets. The combination of mechanisms in the example above shows their power. Through a small number of controls we can define wide-ranging but granular access permissions."}
{"url":"https:\/\/docs.atlan.com\/product\/capabilities\/governance\/access-control\/concepts\/what-are-personas","title":"What are personas? | Atlan Documentation","text":"Personas define policies to control which users can (or cannot) take certain actions on specific assets. They address a combination of two main objectives: Curating the assets that are relevant to a team of users Controlling the actions users can take on those assets (querying data, updating metadata, etc) Think of personas as a way of curating assets for a group of users. Team-based personalization Personas curate the assets that are discoverable by users, and the detailed metadata shown. In this way, users can focus on only those assets (and metadata) relevant to their role in the organization. This reduces distractions and \"noise\" for users. For example, a team of marketers may only work with a few data sets and dashboards. Rather than flooding the marketers with details about every asset in your company, you want to focus their attention. Broad-brush access control Combined with the personalization are broad-brush access control policies. When defining the policies in a persona, you not only select the assets but also what actions users can take on those assets. For example, your team of marketers should be able to describe their dashboards. But perhaps they should only be able to see the shared data sets that feed those dashboards, not change their descriptions or tags. You can define the persona so that they can read and write the dashboards, but only read the data sets. Broad-brush access control"}
{"url":"https:\/\/docs.atlan.com\/product\/capabilities\/governance\/access-control\/concepts\/what-are-purposes","title":"What are purposes? | Atlan Documentation","text":"Purposes provide ways to interact with tagged assets. They address two main objectives: Grouping assets together in ways they may be used by many teams - for example, by project or domain Controlling access to very granular, typically sensitive data When defining a purpose , you choose its tags. Atlan then considers all assets with at least one of those tags as part of the purpose. Think of purposes as a way of further protecting particularly sensitive data. Even if a user can see data in a table, you may not want them to see one or two sensitive columns within that table. Asset curation by domain One way you can use purposes is to curate assets. In this approach, the purpose's tag tends to be a domain. For example, this could be a project or an area of your organization's business. Through the purpose, you can grant permissions to assets with that tag. With purposes, any future assets given a tag will gain the same permissions - no policy changes needed. Granular data protection The other way you can use purposes is to enforce granular data protection. In this approach, the purpose's tag tends to be some level of information sensitivity. For example, this could be personally-identifiable information (PII) or confidential internal financial metrics. These sensitivity tags will tend to be against granular data assets - often columns. Personas tend to control permissions at a broader level, for example entire data sources, databases or schemas. Through these more granular tags, purposes give you more fine-grained control. And you can layer this on top of the permissions granted by personas . For example, you might grant permission to preview and query a database to a group of users through a persona . But you don't want those users to be able to see any PII data - specific columns - wherever they appear in the database. There could be hundreds of these columns, scattered across thousands of tables. By tagging the columns, you can restrict access to them through a single policy in a purpose. This way you don't need to maintain many separate per-column policies through a persona . Asset curation by domain Granular data protection"}
{"url":"https:\/\/docs.atlan.com\/product\/capabilities\/governance\/stewardship\/how-tos\/automate-data-governance","title":"Automate data governance | Atlan Documentation","text":"You must be an admin user in Atlan to enable , create , and manage governance workflows. Anyone with access to Atlan - admin, member, or guest user - can use the inbox . You can streamline your data governance requirements in Atlan with governance workflows and manage alerts, approvals, and tasks using the inbox . Governance workflows enable you to set up robust controls on data access management, metadata enrichment, new entity creation, and more, with out-of-the-box workflow templates and automated execution. For example, instead of allowing your users to directly query data or update the certification status of an asset, you can specify assets that require advanced controls and create governance workflows to govern them. These workflows will run in the background, ensure that all required approvals are in place, and only then approve users with appropriate permissions to perform any action. You can use governance workflows to ensure: Risk mitigation - determine how data is used and shared in your organization with automated access policies. Data security - manage requests for data access and processing to only allow access to authorized individuals or teams. Metadata change management - monitor and audit metadata changes to align with established organizational standards. New entity creation - manage and audit documentation of business context such as glossaries and tags to align with established organizational standards. Policy compliance - set up repeatable processes and approval flows for your data assets in Atlan to adhere to regulatory requirements - currently only applicable if you have also enabled the policy center module . Workflow properties A common set of properties are applicable to all governance workflows in Atlan: Only an admin user can create, update, or delete governance workflows. Out-of-the-box workflow templates. Predefined steps based on workflow selection. Must be associated with an asset type or action. Set up auto-approval rules for users, groups, or owners based on metadata attributes and policies. Activity logs for all workflows available by default. Visibility into the transition states of a workflow. Overlapping workflows - governance workflows provide you with the flexibility of creating workflows per team or business domain on the same set of assets instead of creating one complex workflow to cover all your use cases. Atlan will handle all the complexities, only allowing approvals to go through once all approval conditions have been met. Workflow templates You can choose from the following workflow templates to govern your assets and manage access: Change management This template allows you to control changes to metadata within your organization's data management and governance framework. Use cases include requests to: Add, update, and remove descriptions manually and using Atlan AI Add, update, and remove certificates Add, update, and remove an alias Add, update, and remove owners Attach, update, and remove tags Add, update, and remove custom metadata Add, update, and remove domains Add, update, and remove READMEs Add, update, and remove announcements Change management workflows will override any permissions assigned through user roles or access policies . For example, even for users with edit access , metadata update requests will go through change management workflows. If there are no change management workflows in place, then users with edit access will be able to update metadata while users without edit access will only be able to suggest changes to metadata . New entity creation This template allows you to control the creation and publication of new entities in Atlan. The new entity creation workflow will override existing glossary policies and user role permissions to create new entities. Creation of the following entities is currently supported for the new entity creation workflow: Data products : Creation of a new data product Change of a data product's status from Sunset , Archived , or Draft to Published Creation of a new data product Change of a data product's status from Sunset , Archived , or Draft to Published Access management This template allows you to automate the process of requesting, approving, and revoking access to data assets in Atlan. It includes the combination of a self-service approach as well as mandating human intervention for approval. You can also revoke data access in Atlan or other data sources.

To enable governance workflows and inbox for your Atlan users: From the left menu of any screen in Atlan, click Admin . Under the Workspace heading, click Labs . On the Labs page, under Governance center , turn on Governance Workflows and Inbox to govern your assets and manage alerts, approvals, and tasks in Atlan more effectively. If you'd like to disable the Governance Workflows and Inbox module from your organization's Atlan workspace, follow the steps above to turn it off. Once enabled, you can also temporarily disable the module and turn it on again as needed. For any governance workflows you may have created or existing requests , this will not result in any data loss. Interactions with existing access control mechanisms Once you have turned on governance workflows and inbox, the module will interact with existing access control mechanisms in Atlan as follows: Requests : Atlan will channel requests and approvals through governance workflows and land them in the inbox. New requests - once you have enabled governance workflows and inbox, the requests widget will be replaced by an inbox and your member and guest users will not be able to raise any new requests until an admin user has created at least one governance workflow. To enable your member and guest users to raise new requests in Atlan: Create a change management governance workflow . Select all connections present in your Atlan workspace . Skip auto-approval . Select Anyone approves and list the users or groups designated as your Atlan admins . Publish your first governance workflow! Once published, this comprehensive workflow will allow your member and guest users to raise requests. Now you can focus on creating more use-case-driven workflows and consequently removing governed assets from the first workflow until you no longer need it.

{"url":"https:\/\/docs.atlan.com\/secure-agent\/references\/deployment-architecture","title":"Deployment architecture | Atlan Documentation","text":"The Atlan Secure Agent is a Kubernetes-based application that runs within a customer's environment. It acts as a gateway between the single-tenant Atlan SaaS and external systems like Snowflake, Tableau, and other data sources. This document explains the Secure Agent's deployment architecture, key components, communication flows, and security considerations. High-level architecture This section describes how the Secure Agent is structured and deployed. It explains the core components that enable metadata extraction, job execution, and communication with Atlan. Figure 1: Atlan Secure Agent deployment architecture. Core components The Secure Agent runs as a Kubernetes-based application within a customer's private cloud or on-premises environment. It consists of several key components that work together to execute metadata extraction tasks. Argo Workflows An Argo Workflow server is deployed to coordinate all activities and launch Kubernetes workloads. The Secure Agent uses Argo Workflows to orchestrate and manage metadata extraction jobs. Each workflow represents a unit of work, such as extracting metadata from a source system. Agent orchestrator A scheduled job that runs every five minutes to check for jobs that need to be executed. It connects to the Atlan tenant, retrieves job details, and initiates workflows accordingly. Auxiliary services Additional services that support agent operations: Health monitoring service sends periodic heartbeats to Atlan to confirm the agent is active. Logging service uploads execution logs to Atlan for monitoring and debugging. Metadata extraction workflows Connector-specific jobs that extract metadata from source systems. Workflows run in isolated containers, ensuring security and reliability. Data flow The Secure Agent supports two modes of metadata transfer. Each mode determines how extracted metadata is delivered to Atlan. Bucket relay Metadata extraction in bucket relay mode stores metadata in enterprise-managed cloud storage before Atlan retrieves it. Figure 2: Data flow in bucket relay mode. The Secure Agent extracts metadata and writes it to a storage bucket in the customer s cloud environment (such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage). This is managed by providing the agent write access to cloud storage. Atlan retrieves metadata from the storage bucket and processes it further. This is managed by providing Atlan read access to list and read files in cloud storage. This mode ensures the extracted data remains within the customer s infrastructure until Atlan explicitly fetches it. Customers can also use this data for auditing. Direct ingestion In direct ingestion mode, metadata is transferred directly from the Secure Agent to Atlan. Figure 3: Data flow in direct ingestion mode. The Secure Agent uses pre-signed URLs to upload metadata directly to Atlan. Some cloud storage providers that use pre-signed URLs include: The Secure Agent uses pre-signed URLs to upload metadata directly to Atlan. Some cloud storage providers that use pre-signed URLs include: A pre-signed URL grants temporary access to upload files without exposing long-term credentials. A pre-signed URL grants temporary access to upload files without exposing long-term credentials. Each URL has an expiration time, ensuring access is only available for a limited duration.

You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to create playbooks. A common question that data teams often face is how to automate metadata at scale. Having started out as a data team ourselves, we know that automating repetitive tasks can help data teams maximize the value they provide to their organization. One way of doing so is through Atlan's playbooks! Playbooks help power metadata automation for your data assets in Atlan. You can create rule-based automations at scale and update metadata in bulk, helping you streamline your workflows. You can update the following asset metadata using playbooks: For example, imagine your organization needs to transfer ownership of several data assets. Instead of your data team manually updating the ownership of each and every asset, you can create a playbook to automate this process and update the metadata of your assets at scale. Playbook recommendations Before you begin, review some general guidelines on running playbooks in Atlan: Avoid running multiple playbooks simultaneously on the same set of assets. Allow one playbook run to be completed before proceeding with another operation on the same set of assets. Otherwise, you may experience performance issues and inconsistencies. Review and understand the depth of your asset lineage or hierarchy prior to enabling a tag propagation playbook. For assets with complex lineage, tag propagation may take longer to complete than the playbook runtime. You may want to review and judiciously select a list of assets that need to be tagged directly. For their child and\/or downstream assets, Atlan recommends that you enable tag propagation .

You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to create playbooks. Here are a few things to know about setting up playbooks : Following are the known issues or limitations when using the domain action : If you do not have read permission on the assets you want to add to a domain, those assets will be removed from the playbook workflow during processing. If you do not have update permission on the assets you want to add to a domain, the playbook workflow will fail. However, some assets may still be linked to the domain before the failure occurs. We recommend building no more than a maximum of 20 rules per playbook. However, the total number of playbooks that can be run is still to be determined. From a technical standpoint, playbooks leverage the workflow infrastructure, which means there are no hard limits. Depending on the number of playbooks that need to be run, the infrastructure will have to be scaled accordingly. Yes. You need to have the permission to update assets in Atlan in order to run playbooks for updating them. If you do not have the permission to update an asset, you will be unable to update it using playbooks. Additionally, Atlan uses the permissions of the playbook creator in determining the assets to be updated and not that of the user who runs the playbook. Your user permissions are used to determine the bulk updates you can make to ensure that there is no adverse impact on assets beyond your scope of access. No, Atlan currently does not support automating asset update requests through playbooks. Currently, there is no button to undo asset updates. However, you can modify your existing playbooks . You can either turn off the filters or add new rules to reverse the updates. Currently, no. You can monitor your existing playbooks to view a high-level summary of asset updates from previous playbook runs. Observability of results is on the roadmap. Currently, no. However, you can set up Slack or Microsoft Teams alerts for your playbook runs in Atlan. If you encounter an offload node status is not supported error message, the playbook workflow may have exceeded the EtcD size limit. Playbooks use Argo workflow templates, which are stored as Kubernetes resources. This creates a limit to their size.

As a powerful tool for data management, data contracts can help you standardize contractual obligations between data producers and consumers, organize your assets with embeddable contract metadata, and enforce them with data quality rules. In Atlan, you can directly add a data contract to supported assets and provide helpful context to your downstream users. For a data contract to help build trust in your assets, it should be: Templatized and easily comprehensible - use Atlan's YAML contract template to create standardized contracts and push to Atlan. Version-controlled - continuously validate and monitor your data contracts either in runtime or real-time. Embeddable - embed the contract as metadata for a supported asset. Enforceable - enforce your contracts with data quality rules. Extensible - identify new specifications, generate new versions, and then compare and contrast them. You can create webhooks for data contracts and receive notifications for when a contract is added or updated to a URL of your choice. Supported asset types You can create data contracts for the following asset types: Output port assets of data products Supported asset metadata Atlan maps the following asset metadata properties to it contract properties: Add a data contract to an asset Any non-guest user with edit access to an asset's metadata can create, deploy, and manage data contracts. This only includes admin and member users in Atlan. To add a data contract to an asset, you can either: Create a contract directly in Atlan from the Contracts tab of the asset profile. You can create and maintain data contracts as easily as editing a word document. Use Atlan CLI to import an existing contract from your local machine to Atlan directly or through a CI\/CD pipeline. Atlan CLI is a command-line tool that you can download directly from Atlan to your local machine to create and push data contracts to Atlan. Once you have published the contract, you can also sync metadata from a contract to the governed asset in Atlan. Once created, you will be able to monitor and manage your data contracts in Atlan. To add a data contract: From the left menu of any screen in Atlan, click Assets . (Optional) From the Filters menu on the left, click Properties and then click Has contract . Click No to filter for assets without a contract. From the Assets page, select an asset to open the asset sidebar. In the Contract tab of the asset profile, you can either: Click Create contract to create a draft contract directly in Atlan based on asset metadata.

This can help you analyze proposed changes and mitigate potential risks before implementation. If you have ever changed a data contract only to find out later that it broke a downstream table or dashboard, Atlan provides a GitHub Action to help you out. This action places Atlan's impact analysis right into your pull request. So, you can view the potential downstream impact of your changes before merging the pull request. Before running the action, you will need to create an Atlan API token . You will also need to assign a persona to the API token and add a metadata policy that provides the requisite permissions on assets for the Atlan action to work. For example, you can add the following permissions: Asset, such as a table - Read only Any downstream connections, such as Microsoft Power BI - Read only Asset, such as a table - Read only Any downstream connections, such as Microsoft Power BI - Read only You will need to configure the default GITHUB_TOKEN permissions. Grant Read and write permissions to the GITHUB_TOKEN in your repository to allow the atlan-action to seamlessly add or update comments on pull requests. Refer to GitHub documentation to learn more.

Not sure where to start? Allow us to introduce Atlan development through example. 1 We strongly recommend using one of our SDKs to simplify the development process. As a first step, set one up: The SDK is available on Maven Central , ready to be included in your project: Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include logback as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out). Provide two values to create an Atlan client: Provide your Atlan tenant URL as the first parameter. You can also read the value from an environment variable, if you leave out both parameters. Provide your API token as the second parameter. You can also read the value from another environment variable, by leaving out this parameter. You can then start writing some actual code to run within a static main method. (We'll show some examples of this further below.) Once the block is complete, any resources held by the client (i.e. for caching) will be automatically released.

(Or again, have it picked up automatically by the assets.NewContext() method.) Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in).

You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

(Or again, have it picked up automatically by the assets.NewContext() method.) Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName .

You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes.

You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\". Finally, from the batch you can retrieve the minimal details about any assets it created or updated. Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with).

The batch itself will handle saving these to Atlan when a sufficient number have been queued up (20, in this example).

Obtain the SDK The SDK is available on Maven Central, ready to be included in your project: Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency.

You can include logback as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out), at INFO -level or above. Configure the SDK There are two ways to configure the SDK: Using environment variables ATLAN_API_KEY should be given your Atlan API token , for authentication ( don't forget to assign one or more personas to the API token to give access to existing assets! ) ATLAN_BASE_URL should be given your Atlan URL (for example, https:\/\/tenant.atlan.com ) Here's an example of setting those environment variables: On client creation If you prefer to not use environment variables, you can do the following: Careful not to expose your API token! We generally discourage including your API token directly in your code, in case you accidentally commit it into a (public) version control system. But it's your choice exactly how you manage the API token and including it for use within the client. (Note that you can also explicity provide only the tenant URL, and the constructor will look for only the API key through an environment variable.)

Learn more about events Delve deep into the details of the events Atlan triggers. Learn more about events The SDK defines checked exceptions for the following categories of error: A given API call could fail due to all of the errors above. So these all extend a generic AtlanException checked exception, and all API operations throw AtlanException . For example, when creating a connection there is an asynchronous process that grants permissions to the admins of that connection. So there can be a slight delay between creating the connection and being permitted to do any operations with the connection. During that delay, any attempt to interact with the connection will result in a PermissionException , even if your API token was used to create connection in the first place. Another example you may occasionally hit is some network issue that causes your connection to Atlan to be interrupted. In these cases, an ApiConnectionException will be raised. Don't worry, the SDK retries automatically While these are useful to know for detecting issues, the SDK automatically retries on such problems. Atlan is a distributed, cloud-native application, where network problems can arise. These advanced configuration options allow you to optimize how the SDK handles such ephemeral problems. The SDK uses slf4j to be logging framework-agnostic. You can therefore configure your own preferred logging framework: Replace the ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.11 logback binding with log4j2 bindings. The SDK handles automatically retrying your requests when it detects certain problems: When an ApiConnectionException occurs that is caused by an underlying ConnectException or SocketTimeoutException . When there is a 403 response indicating that permission for an operation is not (yet) available. When there is a 500 response indicating that something went wrong on the server side. If any request encounters one of these problems, it will be retried. Before each retry, the SDK will apply a delay using: An exponential backoff (starting from 500ms) A jitter (in the range of 75-100% of the backoff delay) Each retry will be at least 500ms, and at most 5s. (Currently these values are not configurable.) For each request that encounters any of these problems, only up to a maximum number of retries will be attempted. (This is set to 3 by default.) You can configure the maximum number of retries globally using setMaxNetworkRetries() on a client. Set this to an integer: The SDK will only wait so long for a response before assuming a network problem has occurred and the request should be timed out. By default, this is set to 80 seconds. You can configure the maximum time the SDK will wait before timing out a request using setReadTimeout() on a client. Set this to an integer giving the number of milliseconds before timing out: Remember this must be given in milliseconds. This example sets the timeout to 2 minutes (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds). Since version 0.9.0, the Java SDK supports connecting to multiple tenants. From version 4.0.0 onwards you can create any number of clients against any number of different tenants, since every operation that interacts with a tenant now explicitly requires a client to be provided to it: Constructing a new client with a different tenant's URL is sufficient to create connectivity to that other tenant. You can also (optionally) provide a second argument to directly give the API token for the tenant. Create an object as usual. You can access the operations for assets directly on the client, under client.assets . These will generally give you the most flexibility — they can handle multiple objects at a time and allow overrides. Every operation on the client itself has a variant with an (optional) final argument through which you can override settings like retry limits or timeouts for this single request. You can use the from(client) factory method to initialize the request options with all the settings of your client, and then you only need to chain on those you want to override for this particular request. Alternatively, you can pass the client to the operation on the object itself. Limit the number of clients to those you must have Each client you create maintains its own independent copy of various caches. So the more clients you have, the more resources your code will consume. For this reason, we recommended limiting the number of clients you create to the bare minimum you require — ideally just a single client per tenant. Using a proxy To use the Java SDK with a proxy, you need to send in some additional parameters when running any java . command. These are described in detail in the Java documentation , but are summarized here for simplicity: socksProxyHost should be set to the hostname for your SOCKS proxy socksProxyPort should be set to the port for your SOCKS proxy (default being 1080) Providing credentials to the proxy In either case, if you need to authenticate to your proxy, you will need to wrap whatever code you want to run to set up these credentials using something like the following: You need to create a built-in Java PasswordAuthentication object. Provide your username as the first argument. . and your password as the second argument, as a char[] . (Of course, you should not hard-code your password in your code itself, but rather pull it from elsewhere.) Then use setProxyCredential() to pass this PasswordAuthentication object to the Atlan client, before any of the rest of the code will execute."}

Learn more about events Delve deep into the details of the events Atlan triggers. Learn more about events The SDK defines checked exceptions for the following categories of error: A given API call could fail due to all of the errors above. So these all extend a generic AtlanException checked exception, and all API operations throw AtlanException . For example, when creating a connection there is an asynchronous process that grants permissions to the admins of that connection. So there can be a slight delay between creating the connection and being permitted to do any operations with the connection. During that delay, any attempt to interact with the connection will result in a PermissionException , even if your API token was used to create connection in the first place. Another example you may occasionally hit is some network issue that causes your connection to Atlan to be interrupted. In these cases, an ApiConnectionException will be raised. Don't worry, the SDK retries automatically While these are useful to know for detecting issues, the SDK automatically retries on such problems. Atlan is a distributed, cloud-native application, where network problems can arise. These advanced configuration options allow you to optimize how the SDK handles such ephemeral problems. The SDK uses slf4j to be logging framework-agnostic. You can therefore configure your own preferred logging framework: Replace the org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.7 binding with log4j2 bindings. The SDK handles automatically retrying your requests when it detects certain problems: When an ApiConnectionException occurs that is caused by an underlying ConnectException or SocketTimeoutException . When there is a 403 response indicating that permission for an operation is not (yet) available. When there is a 500 response indicating that something went wrong on the server side. If any request encounters one of these problems, it will be retried. Before each retry, the SDK will apply a delay using: An exponential backoff (starting from 500ms) A jitter (in the range of 75-100% of the backoff delay) Each retry will be at least 500ms, and at most 5s. (Currently these values are not configurable.) For each request that encounters any of these problems, only up to a maximum number of retries will be attempted. (This is set to 3 by default.) You can configure the maximum number of retries globally using setMaxNetworkRetries() on a client. Set this to an integer: The SDK will only wait so long for a response before assuming a network problem has occurred and the request should be timed out. By default, this is set to 80 seconds. You can configure the maximum time the SDK will wait before timing out a request using setReadTimeout() on a client. Set this to an integer giving the number of milliseconds before timing out: Remember this must be given in milliseconds. This example sets the timeout to 2 minutes (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds). Since version 0.9.0, the Java SDK supports connecting to multiple tenants. From version 4.0.0 onwards you can create any number of clients against any number of different tenants, since every operation that interacts with a tenant now explicitly requires a client to be provided to it: Constructing a new client with a different tenant's URL is sufficient to create connectivity to that other tenant. You can also (optionally) provide a second argument to directly give the API token for the tenant. Create an object as usual. You can access the operations for assets directly on the client, under client.assets . These will generally give you the most flexibility — they can handle multiple objects at a time and allow overrides. Every operation on the client itself has a variant with an (optional) final argument through which you can override settings like retry limits or timeouts for this single request. You can use the from(client) factory method to initialize the request options with all the settings of your client, and then you only need to chain on those you want to override for this particular request. Alternatively, you can pass the client to the operation on the object itself. Limit the number of clients to those you must have Each client you create maintains its own independent copy of various caches. So the more clients you have, the more resources your code will consume. For this reason, we recommended limiting the number of clients you create to the bare minimum you require — ideally just a single client per tenant. Using a proxy To use the Java SDK with a proxy, you need to send in some additional parameters when running any java . command. These are described in detail in the Java documentation , but are summarized here for simplicity: socksProxyHost should be set to the hostname for your SOCKS proxy socksProxyPort should be set to the port for your SOCKS proxy (default being 1080) Providing credentials to the proxy In either case, if you need to authenticate to your proxy, you will need to wrap whatever code you want to run to set up these credentials using something like the following: You need to create a built-in Java PasswordAuthentication object. Provide your username as the first argument. . and your password as the second argument, as a char[] . (Of course, you should not hard-code your password in your code itself, but rather pull it from elsewhere.) Then use setProxyCredential() to pass this PasswordAuthentication object to the Atlan client, before any of the rest of the code will execute."}

Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName .

You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\". Finally, from the batch you can retrieve the minimal details about any assets it created or updated. Start by initializing a batch.

We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes.

The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

Not sure where to start? Allow us to introduce Atlan development through example. 1 We strongly recommend using one of our SDKs to simplify the development process. As a first step, set one up: The SDK is available on Maven Central , ready to be included in your project: Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include logback as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out). Provide two values to create an Atlan client: Provide your Atlan tenant URL as the first parameter. You can also read the value from an environment variable, if you leave out both parameters. Provide your API token as the second parameter. You can also read the value from another environment variable, by leaving out this parameter. You can then start writing some actual code to run within a static main method. (We'll show some examples of this further below.) Once the block is complete, any resources held by the client (i.e. for caching) will be automatically released. Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. The SDK is available on PyPI . You can use pip to install it as follows: Provide two values to create an Atlan client: Provide your Atlan tenant URL to the base_url parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .) Provide your API token to the api_key parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .)

Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.)

And in fact if you ultimately intend to update an asset you should trim it down to only what you intend to change and not send a complete asset. See Updating an asset for more details. Retrieving an asset uses a slightly different pattern from the other operations. For this you can use static methods provided by the Asset class: To retrieve an asset by its GUID: If no exception is thrown, the returned object will be non-null and of the type requested. Because this operation will read the asset from Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Compile-time type checking This operation will type-check the asset you are retrieving is of the type requested.

The last (optional) parameter being true indicates you want to retrieve the asset with all its relationships (a \"full\" asset). Similar variations exist on every asset as well as on the dynamically-typed Asset static methods.

Retrieve minimal assets where possible You should retrieve minimal assets for better performance in cases where you do not need all of the relationships of the asset. Keep in mind that although the relationships will not be visible in the object after retrieving a minimal asset, this does not mean that there are no relationships on that asset (in Atlan)."}

Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes.

You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\". Finally, from the batch you can retrieve the minimal details about any assets it created or updated. Start by initializing a batch.

(Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName .

And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID.

You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\". Finally, from the batch you can retrieve the minimal details about any assets it created or updated.

Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes.

You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

Since you should only include your intended changes, and nothing more, the SDKs provide a convenience method to reduce an asset down to its minimal properties. You should use this method to trim an object in your code down to a starting point for the changes you want to make to that asset: Assuming you have an existing asset in a variable called existing , you can call trimToRequired() to reduce it to a builder with the minimal properties needed to update that asset. Assuming you have an existing asset in a variable called existing , you can call trim_to_required() to reduce it to an object with the minimal properties needed to update that asset. Enrich before updating The term object now has the minimal required information for Atlan to update it. Without any additional enrichment, though, there isn't really anything to update. So first you should enrich the object: We'll create an object we can take actions on from this updater. In this example, we're adding a certificate to the object. Note that you can chain any number of enrichments together. Here we are also adding an announcement to the asset. To persist the enrichment back to the object, we must build() the builder. Assign the result back Remember to assign the result of the build() operation back to your original object. Otherwise the result is not persisted back into any variable!

Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan.

And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan.

Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName .

The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\". Finally, from the batch you can retrieve the minimal details about any assets it created or updated. Start by initializing a batch.

(Or again, have it picked up automatically by the assets.NewContext() method.) Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ?

When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName .

The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the Updater() method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns an object into which you can then place any updates. You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

Not sure where to start? Allow us to introduce Atlan development through example. 1 We strongly recommend using one of our SDKs to simplify the development process. As a first step, set one up: The SDK is available on Maven Central , ready to be included in your project: Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include logback as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out). Provide two values to create an Atlan client: Provide your Atlan tenant URL as the first parameter. You can also read the value from an environment variable, if you leave out both parameters. Provide your API token as the second parameter. You can also read the value from another environment variable, by leaving out this parameter. You can then start writing some actual code to run within a static main method. (We'll show some examples of this further below.) Once the block is complete, any resources held by the client (i.e. for caching) will be automatically released. Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. The SDK is available on PyPI . You can use pip to install it as follows: Provide two values to create an Atlan client: Provide your Atlan tenant URL to the base_url parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .) Provide your API token to the api_key parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .)

Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.)

Build-up your changes Next, you iterate through those results and make the changes you want to each one. Use the multiple operations pattern to make multiple changes to each asset. Create a batch of assets to build-up the changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself. The first parameter defines the Atlan tenant on which the batch will be processed The second specifies the maximum number of assets to build-up before sending them across to Atlan Additional parameters By default (using only the options above) no classifications or custom metadata will be added or changed on the assets in each batch. To also include classifications and custom metadata, you need to use these additional parameters: A third parameter of true to replace all classifications on the assets in the batch, which would include removing classifications if none are provided for the assets in the batch itself (or false if you still want to ignore classifications) A fourth parameter to control how custom metadata should be handled for the assets: IGNORE any custom metadata changes in the batch, OVERWRITE to replace all custom metadata with what's provided in the batch (including removing custom metadata that already exists on an asset), or MERGE to only add or update custom metadata based on what's in the batch (leaving other existing custom metadata unchanged) a fifth parameter to control whether failures should be captured across batches ( true ) or ignored ( false ) a sixth parameter to control whether the batch should only attempt to update assets that already exist ( true ) or also create assets if they do not yet exist ( false ) a seventh parameter to control whether details about each created and updated asset across batches should be tracked ( true ) or ignored ( false ) — counts will always be kept an eighth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done in a case-insensitive way ( true ) or case-sensitively ( false ) a ninth parameter to control what kind of assets to create, if not running in updateOnly mode: partial assets (only available in lineage), or full assets a tenth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done strictly according to the data type specified ( false ), or if tables, views and materialized views should be treated interchangeably ( true ) Create a batch of assets to build-up the changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself.

Limit your asset to only what you intend to update When you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request — leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan.

Save them in batches Finally, send the changes you have queued up in batches. Use the multiple assets pattern to update multiple assets at the same time.

All details must still be included in an outer entities array. You need to specify the type for each asset you are updating. You need to specify other required attributes for each asset, such as its name and qualifiedName. Add on any other attributes or relationships you want to set on the asset, such as in the running example a verified certificate and new individual owner. Add another object to the payload to represent another asset that should be updated by the same API call. Once again specify all the required information for that kind of asset, and any of the details for attributes or relationships you want to set. Alternatively, when using an SDK, you can pipeline these operations together. The pipeline will run just as efficiently as the step-by-step approach above: Lazily-fetching each page of results Batching up and bulk-saving changes The qualifiedName of every view starts with the qualifiedName of its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using the qualifiedName .

Create a batch of assets to build-up the changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself.

Including archived (soft-deleted) assets Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use the Asset.TYPE_NAME.in() method to restrict results to only views and materialized views.

(Optional) You can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page. Once you have defined the criteria for your pipeline, call the stream() method to push-down the pipeline to Atlan. This will: Page through the results by lazily fetching each subsequent page as you iterate through them. (So if you use a limit() on the stream, for example, you can break out before retrieving all pages.) Can also run in parallel threads You can also parallel-stream the results by passing true to the stream() method. This will spawn multiple threads that each independently process a page of results and combine the results in parallel. While this can be significantly faster for processing many results, keep in mind if you are collecting the results into any structure that structure must be thread-safe. (For example, you'll need to use things like ConcurrentHashMap rather than just HashMap , and to use ParallelBatch rather than AssetBatch if making changes.) For each result, you can then carry out your changes and submit them into the batch. For each result, you can then carry out your changes and submit them into the batch. Every asset implements the trimToRequired() method, which gives you a builder containing only the bare minimum information needed to update that asset.

Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want.

The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in).

The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

(Or again, have it picked up automatically by the assets.NewContext() method.) Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. Don't forget to give permissions If you want to be able to access existing metadata with an API token, don't forget that you need to assign one or more personas to the API token that grant it access to metadata. Now that you have an SDK installed and configured, you are ready to code! Before we jump straight to code, though, let's first introduce some key concepts in Atlan: What is an asset? In Atlan, we refer to all objects that provide context to your data as assets . Each type of asset in Atlan has a set of: Properties , such as: Certificates Announcements Properties , such as: Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table Relationships to other assets, such as: Schema child tables Table parent schema Table child columns Column parent table In an object-oriented programming sense, think of an asset as an instance of a class. The structure of an asset (the class itself, in this analogy) is defined by something called a type definition , but that's for another day. So as you can see: There are many different kinds of assets: tables, columns, schemas, databases, business intelligence dashboards, reports, and so on. Assets inter-relate with each other: a table has a parent schema and child columns, a schema has a parent database and child tables, and so on. Different kinds of assets have some common properties (like certificates) and other properties that are unique to that kind of asset (like a columnCount that only exists on tables, not on schemas or databases). When you know the asset When you already know which asset you want to retrieve, you can read it from Atlan using one of its identifiers . We'll discuss these in more detail as part of updates, but for now you can think of them as: is a primary key for an asset: completely unique, but meaningless by itself is a business key for an asset: unique for a given kind of asset, and interpretable You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_guid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the asset.get_by_qualified_name() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualified_name . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the static get() method on any asset type, providing the client and either the asset's GUID or qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByGuid() method on the Atlan client, providing both the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its GUID. (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) You can also retrieve an asset using the assets.GetByQualifiedName() method on the Atlan client, providing the type of asset you expect to retrieve and its qualifiedName . (Each asset type is its own unique class in the SDK.) Note that the response is strongly typed: If you are retrieving a table, you will get a table back (as long as it exists). You do not need to figure out what properties or relationships exist on a table - the Table class defines them for for you already. In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes.

And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\".

In any modern IDE, this means you have type-ahead support for retrieving the properties and relationships from the table variable. You can also refer to the types reference in this portal for full details of every kind of asset. Retrieval by identifier can be more costly than you might expect Even though you are retrieving an asset by an identifier, this can be more costly than you might expect. Retrieving an asset in this way will: Retrieve all its properties and their values Retrieve all its relationships Imagine the asset you are retrieving has 100's or 1000's of these. If you only care about its certificate and any owners, you will be retrieving far more information than you need. When you need to find it first For example, imagine you want to find all tables named MY_TABLE : You can then run the request using Execute() . For example, if you want to know the certificate of the asset you only need to tack that onto the query: Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many include_on_results calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can chain as many includeOnResults calls as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Only this line differs from the original query. You can include as many attributes in IncludeOnResults as you want to specify the properties and relationships you want to retrieve for matching assets. Also gives the best performance If all you want to do is check or report on metadata, you should have a starting point from the information above. Or, now that you've found an asset of interest, maybe you want to update the asset with additional metadata ? Once again, before we jump to code, let's first understand some key concepts about how Atlan handles updates: Importance of identifiers Most operations on assets are upserts , that is, they could either create (insert) or update a given asset. How do you know which is going to happen? To answer this question, you need to understand how Atlan uniquely identifies each asset. Recall earlier we discussed asset's different identifiers in Atlan . Every asset in Atlan has at least the following two unique identifiers. These are both mandatory for every asset, so no asset can exist without these: Atlan uses globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) to uniquely identify each asset, globally . They look something like this: As the name implies, GUIDs are: Globally unique (across all systems). Generated in a way that makes it nearly impossible for anything else to ever generate that same ID. 2 Note that this means the GUID itself is not : Meaningful or capable of being interpreted in any way Atlan uses qualifiedName s to uniquely identify assets based on their characteristics. They look something like this: Qualified names are not : Globally unique (across all systems). Instead, they are: Consistently constructed in a meaningful way, making it possible for them to be reconstructed. Note that this means the qualifiedName is: Meaningful and capable of being interpreted How these impact updates Since they are truly unique, operations that include a GUID will only update an asset, not create one. Conversely, operations that take a qualifiedName can: Create an asset, if no exactly-matching qualifiedName is found in Atlan. Update an asset, if an exact-match for the qualifiedName is found in Atlan. These operations also require a typeName , so that if creation does occur the correct type of asset is created. Unintended consequences of this behavior Be careful when using operations with only the qualifiedName . You may end up creating assets when you were only expecting them to be updated or to fail if they did not already exist. This is particularly true when you do not give the exact, case-sensitive qualifiedName of an asset. a\/b\/c\/d is not the same as a\/B\/c\/d when it comes to qualifiedName s. Perhaps this leaves you wondering: why have a qualifiedName at all? The qualifiedName 's purpose is to identify what is a unique asset. Many different tools might all have information about that asset. Having a common \"identity\" means that many different systems can each independently construct its identifier the same way. If a crawler gets table details from Snowflake it can upsert based on those identity characteristics in Atlan. The crawler will not create duplicate tables every time it runs. This gives idempotency. Looker knows the same identity characteristics for the Snowflake tables and columns. So if you get details from Looker about the tables it uses for reporting, you can link them together in lineage. (Looker can construct the same identifier for the table as Snowflake itself.) These characteristics are not possible using GUIDs alone. Limit to changes only Now that you understand the nuances of identifiers, let's look at how you can update metadata in Atlan. In general, you only need to send changes to Atlan. You do not need to send an entire asset each time you want to make changes to it. For example, imagine you want to mark a table as certified but do not want to change anything else (its name, description, owner details, and so on): You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualifiedName . Using the updater() static method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualifiedName and name of the asset. This returns a builder onto which you can then chain any updates. You can then chain onto the returned builder as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . At the end of your chain of updates, you need to build the builder (into an object, in-memory). And then, finally, you need to .save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan (passing the client for the tenant you want to save it in). The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. You can update an asset without first looking the asset up, if you know (can construct) its identifying qualified_name . Using the updater() class method on any asset type, you pass in (typically) the qualified_name and name of the asset. You can then add onto the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to client.asset.save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes.

You can place into the returned object as many updates as you want. In this example, we change the certificate status to VERIFIED . And then, finally, you need to .Save() that object to persist those changes in Atlan. The response will contain details of the change: whether the asset was created, updated, or nothing happened because the asset already had those changes. Atlan will handle idempotency By sending only the changes you want to apply, Atlan can make idempotent updates. Atlan will only attempt to update the asset with the changes you send. Atlan leaves any existing metadata on the asset as-is. If the asset already has the metadata values you are sending, Atlan does nothing. It will not even update audit details like the last update timestamp, and is thus idempotent. What if you want to make changes to many assets, as efficiently as possible? Start by initializing a batch. Through this batch, we can automatically queue up and bulk-upsert assets — in this example, 20 at a time. Be sure to include any details you might need to make a decision about whether to update the asset or not (and what to update it with). You must flush() the batch outside of any loop where you've added assets into it. This ensures any final remaining elements in the batch are still sent to Atlan, even if the batch is not \"full\". Finally, from the batch you can retrieve the minimal details about any assets it created or updated. Start by initializing a batch.

Obtain the SDK The SDK is available on Maven Central, ready to be included in your project: Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include logback as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out), at INFO -level or above. Configure the SDK There are two ways to configure the SDK: Using environment variables ATLAN_API_KEY should be given your Atlan API token , for authentication ( don't forget to assign one or more personas to the API token to give access to existing assets! ) ATLAN_BASE_URL should be given your Atlan URL (for example, https:\/\/tenant.atlan.com ) Here's an example of setting those environment variables: On client creation If you prefer to not use environment variables, you can do the following: Careful not to expose your API token!

Learn more about events Delve deep into the details of the events Atlan triggers. Learn more about events The SDK defines checked exceptions for the following categories of error: A given API call could fail due to all of the errors above. So these all extend a generic AtlanException checked exception, and all API operations throw AtlanException . For example, when creating a connection there is an asynchronous process that grants permissions to the admins of that connection. So there can be a slight delay between creating the connection and being permitted to do any operations with the connection. During that delay, any attempt to interact with the connection will result in a PermissionException , even if your API token was used to create connection in the first place. Another example you may occasionally hit is some network issue that causes your connection to Atlan to be interrupted. In these cases, an ApiConnectionException will be raised. Don't worry, the SDK retries automatically While these are useful to know for detecting issues, the SDK automatically retries on such problems. Atlan is a distributed, cloud-native application, where network problems can arise. These advanced configuration options allow you to optimize how the SDK handles such ephemeral problems. The SDK uses slf4j to be logging framework-agnostic. You can therefore configure your own preferred logging framework: Replace the ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.11 logback binding with log4j2 bindings. The SDK handles automatically retrying your requests when it detects certain problems: When an ApiConnectionException occurs that is caused by an underlying ConnectException or SocketTimeoutException . When there is a 403 response indicating that permission for an operation is not (yet) available. When there is a 500 response indicating that something went wrong on the server side. If any request encounters one of these problems, it will be retried. Before each retry, the SDK will apply a delay using: An exponential backoff (starting from 500ms) A jitter (in the range of 75-100% of the backoff delay) Each retry will be at least 500ms, and at most 5s. (Currently these values are not configurable.) For each request that encounters any of these problems, only up to a maximum number of retries will be attempted. (This is set to 3 by default.) You can configure the maximum number of retries globally using setMaxNetworkRetries() on a client. Set this to an integer: The SDK will only wait so long for a response before assuming a network problem has occurred and the request should be timed out. By default, this is set to 80 seconds. You can configure the maximum time the SDK will wait before timing out a request using setReadTimeout() on a client. Set this to an integer giving the number of milliseconds before timing out: Remember this must be given in milliseconds. This example sets the timeout to 2 minutes (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds). Since version 0.9.0, the Java SDK supports connecting to multiple tenants. From version 4.0.0 onwards you can create any number of clients against any number of different tenants, since every operation that interacts with a tenant now explicitly requires a client to be provided to it: Constructing a new client with a different tenant's URL is sufficient to create connectivity to that other tenant. You can also (optionally) provide a second argument to directly give the API token for the tenant. Create an object as usual. You can access the operations for assets directly on the client, under client.assets . These will generally give you the most flexibility — they can handle multiple objects at a time and allow overrides. Every operation on the client itself has a variant with an (optional) final argument through which you can override settings like retry limits or timeouts for this single request. You can use the from(client) factory method to initialize the request options with all the settings of your client, and then you only need to chain on those you want to override for this particular request. Alternatively, you can pass the client to the operation on the object itself. Limit the number of clients to those you must have Each client you create maintains its own independent copy of various caches. So the more clients you have, the more resources your code will consume. For this reason, we recommended limiting the number of clients you create to the bare minimum you require — ideally just a single client per tenant. Using a proxy To use the Java SDK with a proxy, you need to send in some additional parameters when running any java . command. These are described in detail in the Java documentation , but are summarized here for simplicity: socksProxyHost should be set to the hostname for your SOCKS proxy socksProxyPort should be set to the port for your SOCKS proxy (default being 1080) Providing credentials to the proxy In either case, if you need to authenticate to your proxy, you will need to wrap whatever code you want to run to set up these credentials using something like the following: You need to create a built-in Java PasswordAuthentication object. Provide your username as the first argument. . and your password as the second argument, as a char[] . (Of course, you should not hard-code your password in your code itself, but rather pull it from elsewhere.) Then use setProxyCredential() to pass this PasswordAuthentication object to the Atlan client, before any of the rest of the code will execute."}

The SDK uses logging module of the standard library that can provide a flexible framework for emitting log messages. You can enable logging for your SDK script by adding the following lines above your snippets: You can enable logging by using basicConfig with various logging levels: logging.DEBUG : used to give detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems (mostly used level in SDK). logging.INFO : used to confirm that things are working as expected. logging.WARN : used as an indication that something unexpected happened, or as a warning of some problem in the near future. logging.ERROR : indicates that due to a more serious problem, the SDK has not been able to perform some operation. logging.CRITICAL : indicates a serious error, suggesting that the program itself may be unable to continue running (not used in SDK as of now).

By default, logs will appear in your console. If you want to use file logging, you can add the following line: logging.config.fileConfig('pyatlan\/logging.conf') : this will generate logs according to the configuration defined in pyatlan\/logging.conf and will generate two log files: \/tmp\/pyatlan.log : default log file. \/tmp\/pyatlan.json : log file in JSON format.

The SDK handles automatically retrying your requests when it detects certain problems: When there is a 403 response indicating that permission for an operation is not (yet) available. When there is a 429 response indicating that the request rate limit has been exceeded, and you need to retry after some time. When there is a 50x response indicating that something went wrong on the server side. If any request encounters one of these problems, it will be retried. Before each retry, the SDK will apply a delay using an exponential backoff. (Currently the values for the exponential backoff are not configurable.) For each request that encounters any of these problems, only up to a maximum number of retries will be attempted. (This is set to 5 by default.) By default, the SDK AtlanClient() has the following timeout settings: read_timeout : 900.0 seconds ( 15 minutes) connect_timeout : 30.0 seconds If you need to override these defaults, you can do so as shown in the example below: Since version 1.0.0, the Python SDK supports connecting to multiple tenants.[^1] When you use the AtlanClient() method you are actually setting a default client. This default client will be used behind-the-scenes for any operations that need information specific to an Atlan tenant. When you want to override that default client you can create a new one and use the set_default_client() method to change it: The AtlanClient() method will return a client for the given base URL, creating a new client and setting this new client as the default client. If you want to switch between clients that you have already created, you can use Atlan.set_default_client() to change between them. Limit the number of clients to those you must have Each client you create maintains its own independent copy of various caches. So the more clients you have, the more resources your code will consume. For this reason, we recommended limiting the number of clients you create to the bare minimum you require — ideally just a single client per tenant. (And since in the majority of use cases you only need access to a single tenant, this means you can most likely just rely on the default client and the fallback behavior.) Pyatlan uses the Requests library which supports proxy configuration via environment variables. Requests relies on the proxy configuration defined by standard environment variables http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy, and all_proxy. Uppercase variants of these variables are also supported. You can therefore set them to configure Pyatlan (only set the ones relevant to your needs): To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, use the http:\/\/user:password@host\/ syntax in any of the above configuration entries: Currently, the way this is implemented limits you to either avoiding multiple threads in your Python code (if you need to use multiple clients), or if you want to use multiple threads you should only use a single client. Asynchronous SDK operations To get started, you need to initialize an AsyncAtlanClient : Create an async client using the same configuration pattern as the synchronous client. Concurrent operations for improved performance The real power of async comes from running multiple operations concurrently . Instead of waiting for each operation to complete sequentially, you can execute them in parallel and reduce total execution time: Synchronous : Total time = operation₁ + operation₂ + . + operationₙ Asynchronous : Total time = max(operation₁, operation₂, . , operationₙ) When to use async Async is most beneficial when you have: Multiple independent operations that can run concurrently I\/O-heavy workloads like API calls, database queries, or file operations Long-running operations where parallelization provides significant time savings For simple, single operations, the synchronous client may be more straightforward to use."}

It is available on Maven Central, ready to be included in your project: Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency.

Learn more about events Delve deep into the details of the events Atlan triggers. Learn more about events The SDK defines checked exceptions for the following categories of error: A given API call could fail due to all of the errors above. So these all extend a generic AtlanException checked exception, and all API operations throw AtlanException . For example, when creating a connection there is an asynchronous process that grants permissions to the admins of that connection. So there can be a slight delay between creating the connection and being permitted to do any operations with the connection. During that delay, any attempt to interact with the connection will result in a PermissionException , even if your API token was used to create connection in the first place. Another example you may occasionally hit is some network issue that causes your connection to Atlan to be interrupted. In these cases, an ApiConnectionException will be raised. Don't worry, the SDK retries automatically While these are useful to know for detecting issues, the SDK automatically retries on such problems. Atlan is a distributed, cloud-native application, where network problems can arise. These advanced configuration options allow you to optimize how the SDK handles such ephemeral problems. The SDK uses slf4j to be logging framework-agnostic. You can therefore configure your own preferred logging framework: Replace the org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.7 binding with log4j2 bindings. The SDK handles automatically retrying your requests when it detects certain problems: When an ApiConnectionException occurs that is caused by an underlying ConnectException or SocketTimeoutException . When there is a 403 response indicating that permission for an operation is not (yet) available. When there is a 500 response indicating that something went wrong on the server side. If any request encounters one of these problems, it will be retried. Before each retry, the SDK will apply a delay using: An exponential backoff (starting from 500ms) A jitter (in the range of 75-100% of the backoff delay) Each retry will be at least 500ms, and at most 5s. (Currently these values are not configurable.) For each request that encounters any of these problems, only up to a maximum number of retries will be attempted. (This is set to 3 by default.) You can configure the maximum number of retries globally using setMaxNetworkRetries() on a client. Set this to an integer: The SDK will only wait so long for a response before assuming a network problem has occurred and the request should be timed out. By default, this is set to 80 seconds. You can configure the maximum time the SDK will wait before timing out a request using setReadTimeout() on a client. Set this to an integer giving the number of milliseconds before timing out: Remember this must be given in milliseconds. This example sets the timeout to 2 minutes (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds). Since version 0.9.0, the Java SDK supports connecting to multiple tenants. From version 4.0.0 onwards you can create any number of clients against any number of different tenants, since every operation that interacts with a tenant now explicitly requires a client to be provided to it: Constructing a new client with a different tenant's URL is sufficient to create connectivity to that other tenant. You can also (optionally) provide a second argument to directly give the API token for the tenant. Create an object as usual. You can access the operations for assets directly on the client, under client.assets . These will generally give you the most flexibility — they can handle multiple objects at a time and allow overrides. Every operation on the client itself has a variant with an (optional) final argument through which you can override settings like retry limits or timeouts for this single request. You can use the from(client) factory method to initialize the request options with all the settings of your client, and then you only need to chain on those you want to override for this particular request. Alternatively, you can pass the client to the operation on the object itself. Limit the number of clients to those you must have Each client you create maintains its own independent copy of various caches. So the more clients you have, the more resources your code will consume. For this reason, we recommended limiting the number of clients you create to the bare minimum you require — ideally just a single client per tenant. Using a proxy To use the Java SDK with a proxy, you need to send in some additional parameters when running any java . command. These are described in detail in the Java documentation , but are summarized here for simplicity: socksProxyHost should be set to the hostname for your SOCKS proxy socksProxyPort should be set to the port for your SOCKS proxy (default being 1080) Providing credentials to the proxy In either case, if you need to authenticate to your proxy, you will need to wrap whatever code you want to run to set up these credentials using something like the following: You need to create a built-in Java PasswordAuthentication object. Provide your username as the first argument. . and your password as the second argument, as a char[] . (Of course, you should not hard-code your password in your code itself, but rather pull it from elsewhere.) Then use setProxyCredential() to pass this PasswordAuthentication object to the Atlan client, before any of the rest of the code will execute."}

{"url":"https:\/\/developer.atlan.com\/sdks\/raw\/","title":"Raw REST API - Developer","text":"Raw REST API Walk through step-by-step in our intro to custom integration course (30 mins). There are a number of details and nuances to understand about the underlying REST APIs to use them most effectively: the underlying REST API communications (HTTP protocols, methods, headers, endpoint URLs, response codes, etc) translating the complex JSON structures for each request and response payload knowing exactly which values are required (and which aren't) depending on the object you're interacting with, what operation you're carrying out, etc (including which exact string (and capitalization) to use for values that are really enumerations behind-the-scenes) Ultimately, all pull-based integration mechanisms (including the SDKs) use the REST API; however, the SDKs also encode best practices to avoid the need to understand all these details and low-level nuances. If you want to adopt these best practices from the start, we would strongly recommend directly using any of our SDKs rather than the raw REST APIs directly: That being said, we have documented the raw REST API interactions in most cases. So if you really want to interact with the APIs directly, there should still be some guidance — anywhere you see Raw REST API gives details on endpoint URLs, methods, and payloads. If all you really want to do is some initial experimentation directly against the API, you can use Postman . We do not maintain a Postman collection of requests, but you can use the Raw REST API tab to find the endpoint and an example payload to use for most operations here on developer.atlan.com. Why not just publish an OpenAPI spec? We did try this in the past, as we liked the idea of generating client libraries using tools like the OpenAPI Generator . Unfortunately, in our own testing of these tools, we found that: We could generate code that is free from syntax errors, but the generated code was not fully functional. Problems we found: The generated code drops significant portions of data from payloads. (Our APIs are payload-rich and endpoint-light, while the generators seem to favor endpoint-rich and payload-light APIs.) The various objects the generator creates often make developer consumption cumbersome — long, difficult-to-read object names; many variations of similar objects; and so on. The generated code naturally does not include any validation that can't be encoded in the OpenAPI spec. To add this we'd need to wrap the generated code with another layer anyway. After several attempts at mangling the OpenAPI spec to meet the constraints of the code generator, we eventually decided to go the way we've seen other API-first companies adopt. We found very few API-first companies appear to rely on these code generators, but rather directly maintain their own SDKs for which they may have their own code generators. (Which is in fact exactly what we're doing as well.) Request for feedback If you use the raw REST APIs rather than one of the provided SDKs, we would love to understand more. If you can spare a few minutes to fill out our survey , we would be very grateful!"}
